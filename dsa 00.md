### an algorithm is a set of steps or instruction need to complete a task

* linear search
	* this method is used to search the number (target) in a linear manner this takes the n iteration to complete 
	* n being the target
	* [linear_search.java](./linear_search.java)
* binary search
	* this method starts checking from mid of the array and checks if the target is greater than or less than the mid term if greater the algorithm rejects all the terms less than the mid term and assign a new mid term keeping the old mid term as the first term
	* [binary_search.java](./binary_search.java)
* time complexity
	* the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete a task
* space complexity
	* the amount of memory the algorithm utilise while running
